`gluestack-ui-flutter` is intentionally designed as an optionally styled library, providing you with the flexibility to style your widgets as you prefer. For users looking for a seamless integration experience, we offer the `@gluestack-ui-flutter/lib/src/theme/config`, which comes with pre-configured theme that can easily be integrated within your app for a convenient styling solution.

## Customizing Theme

You can add customize your app theme with help of `gsThemeToken` parameter under `GluestackProvider` inside of `gluestackTokenConfig`.
gluestack-ui for flutter comes with 2 deafult themes, light and dark, named 'light_theme' and 'dark_theme' respectively.
To modify certain specific colors of the base theme, simply create a Map like so:

```
const myTheme = {
  "light_theme": {
    "colors": {
      'primary300': Color(0xffE11D48),
      'primary400': Color(0xffE11D48),
      'primary600': Color(0xffE11D48),
      'primary700': Color(0xffE11D48),
      'success500': Color(0xffE11D48),
    }
  },
}
```

and provide this value to the `gsThemeToken`, as shown below:

```
    return GluestackProvider(
      gluestackTokenConfig: GluestackTokenConfig(
        gsThemeToken: myTheme,
      ),
      child: GSApp(
        theme: GSThemeData.fromTheme('light_theme'),
      ),
    )
```

To dyamically toggle theme application wide, you can provide theme present in the above example like so, here `currentTheme` is a state varaible, value of which can be 'light_theme' or 'dark_theme' or your custom theme name.

```
        theme: GSThemeData.fromTheme(currentTheme),
```

To create a new theme entirely, you can create the `myTheme` variable present in the above examples as shown below:

```
const myTheme = {
  "cyan_theme": {
    "colors": {
      "primary0": Color(0xFFB2EBF2),
      "primary50": Color(0xFF80DEEA),
      "primary100": Color(0xFF4DD0E1),
      "primary200": Color(0xFF26C6DA),
      "primary300": Color(0xFF00BCD4),
      "primary400": Color(0xFF00ACC1),
      "primary500": Color(0xFF0097A7),
      "primary600": Color(0xFF00838F),
      "primary700": Color(0xFF006064),
      "primary800": Color(0xFF004D40),
      "primary900": Color(0xFF00332A),
      "primary950": Color(0xFF00251A),
      "secondary0": Color(0xFFB2EBF2),
      "secondary50": Color(0xFF80DEEA),
      "secondary100": Color(0xFF4DD0E1),
      "secondary200": Color(0xFF26C6DA),
      "secondary300": Color(0xFF00BCD4),
      "secondary400": Color(0xFF00ACC1),
      "secondary500": Color(0xFF0097A7),
      "secondary600": Color(0xFF00838F),
      "secondary700": Color(0xFF006064),
      "secondary800": Color(0xFF004D40),
      "secondary900": Color(0xFF00332A),
      "secondary950": Color(0xFF00251A),
      //... Other theme colors ...
    },
  },
}
```

To check for current theme being used by the application, you can access `GSTheme.of(context).themeId`. Show below is an example of how we can conditionally use values of colors depending on current app theme.

```
  GSTheme.of(context).themeId == 'dark_theme'
          ? const Color(0xFF262626)
          : null,
```

Alternatively, you can try our very own Token Configurator tool which can help you to generate code for theming. This interactive tool not only provides a visual representation of your currently configured theme but also demonstrates how theme and token adjustments can impact your UI/UX.
