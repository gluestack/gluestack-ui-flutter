# Introduction

Customizable Components for React, Next.js, React Native and Flutter with Optional Styling.

gluestack-ui is a universal UI library that provides themed and unstyled components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React, React Native, Next.js, Flutter and Expo.

## Why we built gluestack-ui?

gluestack-ui originally started as part of NativeBase, a universal component library for both React and React Native. However, we realized that not everyone needs all the components from NativeBase, so here we created separate package for each of them to incrementally adopt those and add them directly to your project using CLI.

We also broke down the library into two separate libraries for different responsibilities.

- [gluestack-style](/style/docs) - A high performant styling and universal CSS-in-JS library.
- [gluestack-ui](/ui) - A set of ready-to-use and unstyled components that can be added to any project, across any device and styled to fit your needs.

## Features

- **Consistency**: gluestack-ui provides a consistent design language across different platforms, making it easier to build interfaces that look and feel the same on other devices.

- **Accessibility**: gluestack-ui aims to provide a set of accessible components that work across different platforms and devices. The components have accessibility features such as ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

- **Ease of use**: The gluestack-ui components are designed to be easily customizable. They have clear and concise APIs that make integration into existing projects simple.

- **Optional styling**: gluestack-ui copies the components to your project which enables you to easily customize or change the look and feel of the components.

- **Theming tokens**: gluestack-ui takes a config file in the `GluestackUIProvider`, which contains theme tokens, aliases, component themes, etc, to help with the project requirements.

- **Animation**: gluestack-ui provides a plugin to add support for Animation using Animation libraries like [@legendapp/motion](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/), [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [moti](https://moti.fyi/). [Check here](https://gluestack.io/style/docs).

## Future Considerations

gluestack-ui is committed to continuously expanding its library of components to meet the needs of developers. We plan to add more components to the library, such as navigation, combo box, and accordion. Apart from that, we have plans to introduce bundler plugins in the future to ensure even greater levels of performance.
